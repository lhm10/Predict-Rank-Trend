1. Motivation
It’s an app, app, app, app world – or it may be by as soon as the middle of next year. During 2014, the number of mobile devices is predicted to exceed the number of desktop and laptop personal computers (worldwide), according to research from Morgan Stanley. In simplest terms, Windows 8 is out; Android and iOS are in.
In the foreseeable future, applications on mobile devices will become an integral part of the core business for Internet and other high-tech companies. A large proportion of revenue will be generated through apps and many important company decision-makings will correlate to the performance of their apps.
Since download and rank of an app should directly reflect the popularity, which indirectly reveals its overall performance in the market. Therefore, we will forecast apps’ popularity by predict its download rank level.

2. Problem description
Our objective is to predict apps’ download rank trend. First of all, we will denote k rank levels {𝐻𝑖},𝑖 ∈ 1,2...𝑘. If the rank of an app is R, then ‘beyond rank level 𝐻𝑖’ means that 𝑅 < 𝐻𝑖. For any app in the upcoming T days, we will predict the minimum numbers of days 𝑵𝒊 that the app can stay beyond the corresponding rank level 𝑯𝒊.
